## Instructions for Exercise 4

The goal of this exercise is to use GitHub Actions to stand up a simple CI Pipeline and debug your code.

Your colleague has gone on vacation (suddenly) and left you with their code. A couple of problems have been reported by end-users. It is your job to find those problems and fix them.

Set up the GitHub Actions workflow as a simple CI Pipeline; identify the unsuccessful tests; and make the required changes to get a "green" build:

1. Make sure that your forked repository is up to date. There should be both a ".github/workflows" and a "Module4-Exercise1" folder. Now find the "Actions" tab header and click on it.
